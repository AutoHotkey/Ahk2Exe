# Ahk2Exe #

Ahk2Exe is the official AutoHotkey script to EXE converter, which is written itself in AutoHotkey.

## How to Compile ##

Ahk2Exe must be compiled with itself as it uses compiler directives. (Make sure to use a recent AutoHotkey self-contained binary, version 1.1.)

After unpacking all the source files, run Ahk2Exe.ahk, and drag and drop Ahk2Exe.ahk onto the converter window, then press the 'convert' button.

The resulting Ahk2Exe.exe file should be copied to the Compiler sub-folder under the folder containing AutoHotkey.exe for proper operation.


## To do ##
