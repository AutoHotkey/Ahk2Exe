# Ahk2Exe #

Ahk2Exe is the official AutoHotkey script to EXE converter, which is written itself in AutoHotkey.

## How to Compile ##

Ahk2Exe must be compiled with itself as it uses compiler directives. 

The compilation will also need to use files from a recent AutoHotkey v1.1 self-contained binary, such as an installed version of AutoHotkey.

After unpacking all the source files, run Ahk2Exe.ahk, and drag and drop Ahk2Exe.ahk onto the converter window.

Select a suitable Base file (usually a 32-bit Unicode file) from the recent AutoHotkey download (see above), then press the 'Convert' button.

The resulting Ahk2Exe.exe file should be copied to the Compiler sub-folder under the folder containing AutoHotkey.exe for proper operation.
